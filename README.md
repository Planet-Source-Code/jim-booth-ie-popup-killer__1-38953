## IE PopUp Killer


</div>

### Description

Expanding on Nate Strandberg's excellent code, I have added a few features such as the ability to open a new window by right clicking and also the ability to click a link which normally opens in a new window.

I have also added a flashing icon when a popup is killed so you know. If you want to hear the popup being killed, just uncomment the sndPlaySound code ;-)

Also added code to run the program at window start.
